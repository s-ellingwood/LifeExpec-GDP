# Country Life Expectancy vs. GDP

## Introduction
This project involves the analysis of data from six different countries around the world on their life expectancy and GDP. This data covers every year from 2000 to 2015. Here are a few questions that this project aims to answer:

- Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
- What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
- Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
- What is the average GDP in these nations?
- Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
- Is that correlation statistically significant?

### Data source:
